    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The transforming furikake rice is a delicious Japanese dish where the eggs 
        transform when the gelatinized cubes of flavor melt.

        This dish is found in food wars season 1, episode 2, and is made 
        by Souma. Preparing this dish will leave your friends amazed and 
        waiting for the recipe.
        
        You will need several locally found ingredients. However, if you canâ€™t 
        find sake in your local grocery store, you will have to go to an Asian 
        grocery store.
        
        The sesame oil will give this delicious meal an amazing nutty aroma. 
        Do not be shy with the ginger and the garlic.
        
        The more, the better.  Cook the spring onion with butter before you 
        add it to the eggs during garnishing. This will taste better.
        
        Serve it hot and watch the cubes melt. Enjoy.
