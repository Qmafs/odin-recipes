    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Eggs Benedict Don Fit for a Queen is a dish made by Soma 
        for Erina(the gods tongue)in the finale. These eggs he called fit 
        for a queen.

        It is fine-tuning of the queens egg dish that Erina made in 
        the 13th episode of season 1 and the chicken Egg Tempura Don 
        made by Soma in episode 50.
        
        This dish consists of many ingredients, some of which you will 
        only get in an Asian grocery store. This recipe is a bit long 
        and complicated.
        
        But if you follow it to the latter, it will result in a delicious, 
        mouth-watering dish. You will have to cook different dishes apart 
        before you assemble.
        
        To assemble, combine the plain white rice with some reserved diced konbu. 
        Add some herbs. Then place your tonkatsu over the rice and finally 
        the tempura egg on the tonkatsu. Finally, glaze with the sauce. 
        Garnish with spring onions.
