    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gotcha Roasted Pork is probably the most popular Food Wars dish. 
        Everyone seems to know how to make it, and it is delicious. 
        Making Gotcha roasted pork is fun if you like experimenting.
        One of the hacks of a perfect gotcha roasted pork is using a lifted pan. 
        This will stop your pork from sitting on a lot of bacon fat that you will 
        experience if using a normal roasting pan.
        
        You can also peel your potatoes before steaming. I find it easier, 
        but the recipe suggests steaming first then peeling to ensure you 
        do not waste it.
        
        A good gotcha roasted pork should take around 4 hours of cooking time, 
        therefore prepare it ahead of time.  As the meat roasts, prepare the sauce.
        
        Serve the gotcha roasted pork hot with the sauce and a side dish of 
        steamed broccoli.
